Septu - an Auth Driver for Laravel
==================================
Welcome to Septu!  Hopefully you will find this bundle simple and easy to use. I'm not very creative when it comes to writing docs, so I'll just go ahead and dive right into the details.

Getting Septu:
--------------
Clone or Download Septu into your Laravel installation's bundles directory. You can download the latest version zipped version of Septu [here](https://github.com/dberry37388/septu-laravel_auth_driver/zipball/master) or go into your laravel/bundles directory and run the following git command:

    git clone -b master git@github.com:dberry37388/septu-laravel_auth_driver.git septu

You should now have the latest stable version of Septu in your laravel bundles directory.
